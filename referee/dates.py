# three different ways, the third using "ऑ", the candra-O sign typically
# reserved for English loanwords). Not exhaustive for every month, just
# every spelling actually observed in this project's own corpus/transcripts
# so far. Add to this as new variants turn up live, rather than guessing all
# twelve months' alternates up front - the recurring pattern (three
# spellings for ONE month already) suggests more are likely still out there
# for months not yet seen enough times to have surfaced a variant.
